        Second-Harmonic Dispersion Interferometer (SHDI),
        2-D Density Imaging Measurements in Plasma & Neutral Gas
    </h1>

    <p class="close-out-sale">CLOSE-OUT SALE PRICE: $28,900.00</p>

    <p>We are closing the SHDI product line and selling our laboratory instrument for a deeply discounted price. The SHDI's lower-limit sensitivity depends on the refractive index and thickness of the sample and the instrument can be used to provide repetitively-pulsed, 2-dimensional, density-profile imaging/measurements in plasma and gas, where the areal-electron density is: ∫ nexdl ≥ 10<sup>14</sup>cm<sup>-2</sup> for plasma, or the areal-neutral density is: ∫ n0xdl ≥ 10<sup>16</sup> cm<sup>-2</sup> for neutral gas. The SHDI may also be used to quantify the thickness of optically transparent mediums such as liquids and solids. Multiple papers have been published by our group documenting the development and operation of the SHDI used in the measurement of plasma density and neutral-gas density.<sup>1 - 5</sup> A quick description of the SHDI is available in the following brochure, downloaded <a href="pdfs/2D-SHDI_2020-2.pdf" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

    <p>The simplified operating principles for the SHDI are schematically illustrated in the Figure shown below. The design uses a single, primary laser beam source and homodyne detection, which provides a common-beam path for all laser beams. In the first crystal (SH1) a second harmonic is created from the primary beam, allowing the sample to be probed at two wavelengths and producing a phase shift by optical dispersion. In the second crystal (SH2) another second harmonic is created that reproduces the phase shift of the residual primary beam, allowing the dispersive-phase shift to be subsequently measured between the two second-harmonic beams. The result is a single, common-path optical design that is immune to mechanical and electrical noise, is less complex and lower cost than alternative (dual-beam line) interferometers. Moreover, the entire instrument only needs one viewing path through the sample and can be mounted as two separable, lightweight components on the experimental device, or nearby with a direct line-of-sight.</p>

    <p>The principal features and characteristics of the SHDI are as follows:</p>

    <ol>
        <li>Large vibration isolation tables are unnecessary, the optical units may be mounted directly on the experiment.</li>
        <li>The SHDI can measure large, and small sample sizes, with transverse dimensions from mm's - 10's of cm's .</li>
        <li>The time resolution can range from Δ t ~ ns - seconds, using an appropriate laser.</li>
        <li>The phase resolution measurement can range from as little as, Δ φ ~ 10<sup>-2</sup> - radians.</li>
        <li>Bandwidth and sensitivity can be tailored for CW or pulsed measurements.</li>
        <li>The image recording times as short at 0.5 ns have been achieved.</li>
        <li>User-friendly software provides for quick-image visualization and data analysis.</li>
        <li>A complete system can be custom designed for the application, in order to keep costs low.</li>
        <li>Large sample gradients, beam deflections, and fringe jumps may limit the spatial resolution.</li>
    </ol>

    <p>An assembled, complete SHDI is illustrated in the Figure below, with system rigidly mounted in a ThorLabs cage system. In this configuration the SHDI produces a 7-mm diameter probe beam, with the laser mounted on the right end of the Optical Unit 1 (OU1) cage system and the digital cameras (i.e., signal detectors) mounted at the left end of Optical Unit 2 (OU2). The object shown at the center is a pulsed gas valve which produced an uncollimated gas jet injected into air, that was sampled by the SHDI. The length of OU1 is approximately 400mm and the length of OU2 is approximately 500 mm; the transverse width (for both OUs) is approximately 80 mm. The laser-pulse duration is 0.6 ns and the repetitive sampling rate is 100 fps.</p>

    <p>Other components mounted in this system include: beam-line optics to adjust the diameter of the laser beam at various points in the instrument; Thorlabs PIN photodiode to detect the beam; two LaB<sub>6</sub> second harmonic crystals (10 x 10 mm); two crystal-oven heaters; a programmable two-channel oven controller; piezo-electric optical-phase controllers; two Basler ACE 1920x1200 100 Hz area scan digital cameras; a Quantum Composers 4-channel trigger unit to command trigger the laser and cameras; two (12" x 24") optical breadboards.</p>

    <p>An enhanced version of the SHDI uses a laser-beam diameter increased to 35-mm diameter, in order to allow for density-profile imaging of large-transverse area samples. This configuration is shown in the Figure below, where the laser beams are expanded prior to entering the sample using first-surface, mirror-beam expanders. An identical, mirror-optics combination is after the sample to reduce the beam back to its original diameter. The mirrored-beam expanders consist of a convex, first-surface mirror and an off-axis parabolic mirror. All components, except for the parabolic mirror, are co-axially and rigidly mounted in a ThorLabs cage system.</p>

    <p>The measured performance for the above, large-area beam SHDI demonstrates that the probe-beam diameter can be increased beyond current levels, limited to the availability of suitable mirrored components. Employing the use of a newer series of fast-frame-rate digital cameras would allow the instrument to provide near real time density imaging at frame rates approaching a kHz.</p>

    <p>The SHDI system offered for sale includes the all of the beam-line optics and hardware illustrated in the figures and described above. Also included is an extra pair of LaB6 crystals, as well as various extra optics mounts, lenses, beam expanders, pinholes, cage-mount components, etc. The combined price for all of these h/w components is roughly one-third their original retail price. The interferometer system also includes the software operating system that is used for system alignment and density measurement. All software is written in Python, for ease of understanding, maintenance, and modification.</p>
